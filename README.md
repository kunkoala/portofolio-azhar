A personal portofolio website project that showcases my ability to do a fullstack project, leveraging state-of-the-art technologies such as Next.js and FastAPI.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server for the front-end inside the front-end directory:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Run the back-end FastAPI using uvicorn or a built-in fastAPI command in the backend directory

```
fastapi dev main.py
```
